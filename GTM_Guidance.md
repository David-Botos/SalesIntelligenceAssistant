# Go-To-Market Playbook for Early-Stage B2B Startups: A VC Evaluation Framework

## Introduction
This document summarizes the essential components of an effective go-to-market (GTM) strategy for early-stage B2B startups, based on the Forum Ventures GTM Playbook. It outlines how VCs evaluate market readiness and provides a framework for founders to develop a compelling GTM approach that will resonate with investors and drive early customer acquisition.

## The 7 Pillars of a Strong GTM Strategy

### Pillar 1: Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) Identification

**Core Principle:** "Ignore your TAM. Focus on your ICP."

VCs look for startups that demonstrate precise understanding of their early customer base rather than pursuing a broad market approach. An effective ICP identification should:

1. **Define a prospect that:**
   - Experiences the pain your solution solves right now
   - Has a relatively simple decision-making structure OR is a known early adopter
   - Has (or can allocate) budget to solve their problem

2. **Segment properly by customer size:**

| Segment | Initial Segment Size | Decision Makers | Annual Deal Size |
|---------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| SMB | 1,000-2,500+ | 1-4 | $5,000-$59,999 |
| Mid-Market | 150-250 | 5-15 | $60,000-$99,000 |
| Enterprise | 50-100 | 15+ | $100,000+ |

3. **Further refine ICP based on:**
   - Geography
   - Industry
   - Revenue
   - Number of employees
   - Platform usage
   - Level/seniority

4. **Focus on early adopters:**
   - Innovators (2.5% of market): Want to be part of cutting-edge community, provide candid feedback
   - Early Adopters (13.5% of market): First users of polished solution, help test scalable sales channels

**Example:** Wave (invoicing SaaS)
- **ICP:** White-collar service freelancers in North America
- **Pain:** Manual invoice creation and payment collection
- **Solution:** Free invoicing platform with payment processing fee
- **Outcome:** 2 million freelancers using platform, $400M exit to H&R Block

**VC Evaluation Metric:** Does the startup demonstrate clear understanding of who will buy first and why?

### Pillar 2: Founder Story

**Core Principle:** "Use your founder story to frame the problem in the buyer's mind."

VCs assess whether founders have crafted a compelling narrative that connects their personal experience to the problem and solution. An effective founder story should follow this narrative arc:

1. The challenge that led to experiencing the problem
2. Personal experience with the problem
3. Trends that helped realize the scope of the problem
4. How the root of the problem was identified
5. Why current solutions didn't work
6. What the problem really needed

**Example:** Firstbase (remote work equipment platform)
- **Story Core:** "We missed our kids walking, laughing and talking for the first time."
- **Problem:** Remote work equipment management was expensive and time-consuming
- **Solution:** Platform for deploying, supporting, and managing physical equipment for remote workers
- **Credibility:** Founders had experience deploying equipment in challenging environments

**VC Evaluation Metric:** Is the founder's connection to the problem authentic and compelling?

### Pillar 3: Value Proposition

**Core Principle:** "If there's not a compelling reason to change, people just won't."

VCs look for value propositions developed through rigorous customer discovery and validation. The process should include:

1. **Customer Discovery:**
   - Segment customers by characteristics
   - Identify pains for each segment
   - Prioritize pains by cost/impact
   - Assign tangible costs to pains

2. **Pain Validation:**
   - Conduct 5-10 unbiased customer calls
   - Understand how they currently solve problems
   - Validate the magnitude of pain points
   - Aggregate findings to inform product development

3. **Value Proposition Development:**
   - Prioritize based on biggest pain, largest opportunity, most money, or biggest+easiest
   - Create a proposition that is:
     - Relevant: Clearly explains how you solve a problem
     - Differentiated: Why your business specifically
     - Quantified: Explicit about specific benefits
     - Comparative: Makes clear how you're better than competitors

**Example:** Evernote
- **Value Proposition:** "Your notes. Organized. Effortless."
- **Relevance:** Addresses content organization needs
- **Differentiation:** Focus on organization effort, not note-taking
- **Comparison:** "Nothing falls through the cracks" (implying other systems fail)

**VC Evaluation Metric:** Has the startup validated pain points with real customers and created a compelling, differentiated value proposition?

### Pillar 4: Positioning

**Core Principle:** "Positioning is how your customers see you as solving their problems compared to available alternatives."

VCs evaluate whether founders understand how to strategically position their product in the market. Effective positioning follows a narrative journey:

1. **Problem:** Identify villains (time, pressure, philosophical issues) and alternatives (workarounds, competitors, doing nothing)
2. **Guide:** Your value proposition that addresses all alternatives and villains
3. **Plan:** How to purchase, work with you, and overcome obstacles
4. **Action:** Make sign-up/engagement easy
5. **Comparative:** Differentiating feature, proof point, credentials, or case study

**Example:** #paid (creator marketing platform)
- **Positioning:** "Marketers are interested in influencer marketing but are concerned about shady influencers, long lead times, and limited performance data. #Paid is a creator platform that helps marketers quickly launch campaigns directly with creators. This means they can develop a whole campaign in under a day with performance analytics to track campaign success or triggers to notice if the campaign isn't delivering and shut it off."

**Signs of great positioning:**
- Prospects can pitch your company better than you can
- Customers intuitively "get" you
- Customers find novel ways to use your product
- Customers stay even when prices increase
- Sales cycles are shorter than industry average

**VC Evaluation Metric:** Does the positioning create a clear, compelling, and differentiated place in the market?

### Pillar 5: Pillar Story

**Core Principle:** "A pillar story is like a manifesto."

VCs look for a comprehensive narrative that combines founder story and value proposition into a long-form piece that can be used internally, with prospects, and with anyone who wants to understand the startup's mission.

**Pillar Story Structure:**
1. **The Problem:**
   - What problem does your audience face?
   - What's the impact of the problem?
   - How has the problem evolved?
   - How is it currently solved?

2. **The Market:**
   - Why solve this problem now?
   - What misconceptions exist about the market?
   - What trends will impact the market?

3. **The Solution:**
   - What current solutions exist?
   - Why are they inadequate?
   - What is your solution?
   - How is it unique/different?

**Example Outline:**
- X problem affects Y people
- Which has Z consequences
- The current solutions, ABC, are inadequate for DEF reasons
- Which has further QRS consequences
- People really want a solution that looks like JKL
- Our market insight shows a new way is possible
- That leads to our solution, built in JKL ways to address DEF inadequacies
- And that yields a legitimate solution to X problem and Z consequences for Y people

**VC Evaluation Metric:** Has the startup created a comprehensive story that effectively communicates their vision, problem understanding, and solution approach?

### Pillar 6: Pricing

**Core Principle:** "Pricing is the exchange rate on the value you're creating in the world."

VCs assess whether startups have developed a pricing strategy based on customer value rather than costs or competitive benchmarking. Effective pricing strategies should:

1. **Target two key goals:**
   - 1% increase in average revenue per unit (ARPU)/average contract value (ACV)
   - Net decrease in customer churn

2. **Identify differentiable features:**
   - High Value/High WTP: Features everyone will pay for
   - Low Value/High WTP: Add-on opportunities for select segments
   - High Value/Low WTP: Core features expected in the solution
   - Low Value/Low WTP: Features to eliminate

3. **Conduct price research:**
   - Use "most-least" valuable comparisons for features
   - Establish price ranges with specific questions:
     - At what price point is it too expensive?
     - At what price is it expensive but still worth it?
     - At what price is it a really good deal?
     - At what price is it too cheap to trust?

4. **Follow a structured pricing strategy:**
   - Develop buyer personas with pain levels and WTP
   - Conduct sentiment research for differentiable features
   - Consider positioning impact on price perception
   - Set packages (typically 3) and test

**VC Evaluation Metric:** Is pricing value-based rather than cost-based, and does it demonstrate understanding of what customers will pay for?

### Pillar 7: Customer Champions

**Core Principle:** "Selling is about making your customer's life easier."

VCs look for startups that know how to cultivate customer champions through value-focused business cases. Effective approaches include:

1. **Developing a TIM-based business case:**
   - **T**ime your solution saves
   - **I**mage your solution props up or defends
   - **M**oney your solution generates

2. **Creating compelling TIM stories:**
   - Frame the problem at strategic and specific levels
   - Present your solution in context of their specific use case
   - Support with relevant case studies

3. **Building business case presentations:**
   - Executive summary of mission and benefits
   - General proposal of how you help companies
   - Supporting points for key use cases
   - Relevant case studies
   - Implementation plan
   - Clear next steps

**VC Evaluation Metric:** Does the startup understand how to communicate value in customer terms and cultivate champions within customer organizations?

## Next Steps: ICP Mapping and GTM Execution

After developing the seven pillars, VCs assess the startup's approach to:

1. **ICP Mapping:** Identifying specific access points to reach early customers through:
   - Personal networks
   - Cold outreach
   - Social media
   - Forums/online communities
   - Founder-led content
   - Directories

2. **GTM-to-Sales-and-Marketing:** Translating GTM components into:
   - Marketing copy and tactics
   - Sales scripts
   - Customer onboarding

**Critical Finding:** "68% of the buying process happens before someone reaches out to you" (CB Insights)

## VC Evaluation Framework Summary

When evaluating GTM readiness, VCs typically assess:

1. **ICP Clarity:** Is the target customer segment narrow, specific, and reachable?
2. **Problem-Solution Fit:** Is there clear evidence the solution addresses a significant pain point?
3. **Value Quantification:** Can the startup articulate the ROI for customers?
4. **Go-to-Market Approach:** Is there a clear, practical path to reaching initial customers?
5. **Unit Economics:** Do the customer acquisition costs make sense relative to customer lifetime value?
6. **Market Timing:** Is the market ready for this solution now?
7. **Sales Cycle Understanding:** Does the team understand the steps and timeline to close?
8. **Initial Traction:** Has the startup demonstrated some early wins or validation?
9. **Competitive Positioning:** Is there a clear differentiation from alternatives?
10. **Scaling Potential:** Is there a path from initial ICP to broader market segments?

## Final Thoughts

A strong GTM strategy provides investors with confidence that a startup understands not just what they're building, but who they're building it for, how they'll reach them, and why customers will buy. When evaluating GTM approaches, VCs are essentially assessing whether a startup has a realistic path to market traction that can eventually lead to significant scale.
