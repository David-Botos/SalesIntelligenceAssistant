HSDS Reference

The Human Services Data Specification defines a set of objects and the relationships between them.

This page provides the canonical definition of each object and its required or optional fields.

A collection of HSDS data can be serialized as a Tabular Data Package consisting of CSV files for each of the objects required, and a package descriptor (datapackage.json) file adapted from the current HSDS specification to include any additional fields and metadata from the data publisher.

Names and descriptions

Locations, Services and Organizations all have name and description field that can contain free text.

A name and alternate_name field should only ever include plain text, without formatting.

A description field may include HTML elements or Markdown, with special characters escaped or encoded.

Consuming applications that expect plain-text only should strip HTML tags from these fields.

Publishers should also be aware that some applications may wish to extract a ‘short description’ from the description field, and may do so by looking for the first full sentence, or first line-break.

Objects and fields
organization

The organization record is used to provide basic description and details about each organization delivering services. Each service should be linked to the organization responsible for its delivery. One organization may deliver many services.
