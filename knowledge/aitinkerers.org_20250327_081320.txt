**Q: What is AI Tinkerers?**

AI Tinkerers is a meetup designed exclusively for practitioners who possess technical, machine learning, and entrepreneurial backgrounds and are actively building and working with foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) and generative AI. If you’re deeply passionate about creating LLM-enabled applications, have hands-on experience in building such systems, and are eager to connect with like-minded individuals who share your level of commitment, then this group is the perfect fit for you. With AI Tinkerers meetups taking place in multiple cities, we cater to a dedicated community of practitioners.

**Q: Who is AI Tinkers for and who is it not for?**

A: We’re not “AI Enthusiasts”, we are AI Tinkerers. We are highly technical, active builders coming together to share our technical innovations, explorations and learnings. You can think of us as a “homebrew computing club of AI” and not a generalist AI networking group or “demo day” type of forum. There are many meetups related to the tech industry, startups and even AI that veer to the business networking side, but what makes AI Tinkerers different and special is our focus on curation to active builders (only).

Our gatherings are **not** suitable for those looking to enter the field, individuals seeking to market their services like SaaS sales, consulting or recruiting, angel investors aiming to connect with prospective founders, or professionals looking for early stage clients, etc.

If you attend AI Tinkerers, it is because you’re actively tinkering on LLMs and generative AI and you’ve built something you’re eager to share with other like-minded builders.

We maintain that cultivating a concentrated group of practitioners helps to establish a climate of trust, transparency and cooperation. Such an environment is which essential for driving meaningful progress in the realm of AI-powered applications.

The core essence of AI Tinkerers lies in active collaboration surrounding early-stage discovery and innovation, which requires a high degree of experimentation, vulnerability, openness to sharing challenges and learnings, and collaboration among individuals with a shared level of expertise. This unique environment allows us to push the boundaries of what’s possible with AI and LLMs while maintaining a strong sense of camaraderie and mutual support.

**Q: How is AI Tinkerers different from other events?**

A: AI Tinkerers stands out through its rigorous screening and focus on community demos

At typical meetups, participants often spend the first 5 minutes assessing whether the person they’re speaking with is worth engaging and another 5 minutes trying to gracefully exit the conversation if they’re not. However, at AI Tinkerers, we ensure that everyone you meet is valuable and worth your time, thanks to our rigorous screening process.

Additionally, AI Tinkerers events prominently feature technology demos from practitioners. These demos are a key highlight, where attendees present their projects, share technical challenges, and showcase innovative solutions they’ve developed. This hands-on, technical focus differentiates AI Tinkerers from other events that might lean more towards business networking, pitching and general discussions. Our emphasis on active building and sharing technical insights creates a unique environment conducive to meaningful collaboration and learning.

**Q: I registered weeks ago but never got a confirmation of acceptance. Assume my RSVP not approved?**

A: Our events are popular and space is limited. As mentioned above, we are unique in our commitment to curating attendees to those who are actively building and fairly well deep in.

If the info you provided with your registration (your LinkedIn, GitHub or biographical profile info) has very little information that can help the organizers to select you above other applicants (because for example it’s not possible to see that you’re actively building or capable of tinkering), then your registration will not be confirmed. If your day job is investor, then you will not be confirmed (but you may be asked to [sponsor](https://aitinkerers.org/sponsors) a future meetup.)

**Q: I’ve registered a few times, even quickly, and yet I’m always on the wait list! Can you let me in already?**

A: This meetup is different from an lot of other meetups on that it is about sharing technical contributions with other technical builders, not business/strategy/general networking/pitching/breaking into AI/startup stuff/etc for which there are many other meetups. That said, because AI is “hot”, demand is high, space is limited, and we have to screen.

Thus, I recommend you add your GitHub URL so that organizers have more to go on re: your active builder contributions to the community. Or for example, if you’re going to email the organizers asking for a special pass to get in, perhaps include a project you’ve built or brief explanation how you will raise the bar for the community on a technical level.

Note that organizers can and will make room for folks with technical backgrounds who are early in their careers or still in school.

That said, if the group isn’t a fit for you, there is an unsubscribe link on the footer of every email. Thanks for your understanding.

**Q: How often does AI Tinkerers meet?**

A: AI Tinkerers meets approximately once a month, but it depends on the city, so be sure to check the specific meetup details for your location via the website.

**Q: Where are the AI Tinkerers meetups held?**

A: The location of the meetups varies and typically rotates among different funds, studios, and incubators. For other cities hosting AI Tinkerers events, the location may also vary. Be sure to check our website or Discord server for the latest information on upcoming meetups.

**Q: What happens at the AI Tinkerers meetups?**

A: At AI Tinkerers meetups, attendees gather to share their experiences, knowledge, and insights in the realm of foundation models and LLM-enabled applications. The events usually feature technology demos from presenters. After the demos, there’s an opportunity for networking among attendees, allowing them to connect, collaborate, and foster community. Occasionally, hackathons or other interactive activities may also take place during the meetups, or special guest spotlight topics and deeper dives with industry experts.

**Q: I’m interested in sponsoring an AI Tinkerers event. How can I do that?**

A: While our primary focus is on fostering a community of practitioners actively building AI-powered applications, we offer various sponsorship opportunities for investors to engage with the AI Tinkerers community. These include:

*   Basic Meetup Sponsorships
*   Themed “Takeovership” Events
*   Competitive Hacking Events and Hackathons
*   VIP Dinners
*   Enterprise AI Innovation Workshops

Each option provides unique ways to connect with top AI talent, showcase your brand, and contribute to the AI innovation ecosystem.

For detailed information on our sponsorship programs, including available roles and benefits, please visit the [dedicated sponsorship page](https://aitinkerers.org/sponsors) which is linked from the header of every city page and from the main site. There, you’ll find comprehensive details on how to get involved and support the AI Tinkerers community while maintaining our focus on active AI practitioners.

**Q: If I sponsor, do I receive a list of the emails and profiles of attendees?**

A: We value the privacy and trust of our members, which is why we do not share their contact information with sponsors. Providing attendee lists benefits only individual KPIs for email list building and not the broader community. Our members, including CTOs and highly sought-after technical professionals, already face a barrage of unsolicited AI-generated emails, LinkedIn messages, Twitter DMs, and phone calls daily. One of our core commitments to our members is to protect them from such invasions by not sharing their contact details.

To foster meaningful connections, we encourage sponsors to engage with members in person at our events. Sponsoring gives you the opportunity to collaborate with city organizers to host break-out group dinners or other opt-in forums, enhancing networking and relationship-building in a more genuine and impactful way. It’s also possible to setup a laptop at the event or a QR code to encourage opt-in sign ups to sponsor programs.

**Q: I’m interested in sponsoring an smaller break-out dinner with a subset of folks who are interested in a particular sub-topic XYZ, can you help me with that?**

A: Absolutely! This aligns well with our VIP Dinners sponsorship option. These events offer an intimate setting for focused discussions on specific AI topics with key community members.

To explore this and other sponsorship opportunities, please visit our dedicated sponsorship page. You’ll find information on all our sponsorship options, including VIP Dinners. If you have specific ideas or requirements, we’re happy to work with you to create an event that aligns with your interests and our community’s focus on AI innovation.

**Q: I’m an investor, actively investing in AI companies, and I have technical background, and I’m tinkering, can you get me off the wait list?**

A: AI Tinkerers is perhaps different from other meetups in that’s 100% active builders. That means that investors if that’s the day job, even if their background is technical, don’t get in. Period.

All sort of good things happen when it’s 100% active builders. Our participants walk away saying, “it was amazing! literally everyone I met is building something.”

The bottom line is that AI Tinkerers only accepts people who are writing AI code professionally. Investors who were founding AI scientists who are now investors, former CTOs who are now investing, etc, even though they would have qualified at one point in our career, may not attend, however they may sponsor.

One way we’ve worked with seed and other investors who are interested in participating in the community is by facilitating smaller groups (e.g. subsets of the demo proposals or other members) into break-out dinners, sponsored by those investors. The can be thematic dinners to discuss a technical area of vertical application area, or workshops on “how early stage funding works” or dinners with VIP. If you’d like to participate in this way, please reach out to the organizers of the city you’re interested in supporting.

Some of the cities keep the bar even higher – seeking out sponsors for the meetups who are themselves actively Tinkerering (e.g. CTOs of leading AI companies). Here’s an email from an AI Tinkerer city organizer to a VC:

**Q: Are there AI Tinkerers events in other cities?**

A: Yes, there are AI Tinkerers meetups happening in various cities, including Austin and San Francisco. Each city may have its own format and schedule, so be sure to check the specific details for the location you’re interested in.

**Q: Where can I find more information about AI Tinkerers?**

A: Here on this site! Select the city and then check out the posts. Each city is a separate blog with separate email lists, and some (if not most) posts will have event RSVP forms attached.

**Q: I registered for an event but I’m still waiting to hear back if I’m “in” or not. How long will this take?**

A: Our events are very popular and we screen attendance. Getting in is not a matter of being first to register but rather a matter of standing out as an active builder. Screening takes place all the way up until just a day or two before event day. When you’re “in” you’ll receive and email with a special QR code to get you into the event. **TIP:** fill out your profile with detailed information and include all your social profile links to help you stand out to the organizers.

(For a deep-dive on this topic, see “Screening Attendees for AI Tinkerers: A Guide” in our [City Organizer’s Guide](https://aitinkerers.org/p/ai-tinkerers-city-organizer-quickstart-guide))

**Q: I’m interested in giving a lightning talk or demo. How should I prepare and what should I focus on?**

A: We’re excited to hear that you want to share your work in a lightning talk or demo! When preparing, focus on presenting a technical demonstration of a novel and interesting project you’ve built. Your talk should be around 5 minutes total and dive straight into the technical aspects of your project.

No pitches! These are not about promoting your startup or service _at all_. These are 100% about sharing in a challenge, learning or discovery. There is a basic “no slides rule” which means: no slides. If you do have a slide, because it’s helpful to show graph or data output, then fine. AI Tinkers is the AI, modern day equivalent of the homebrew computer club. (It’s not Yet Another Demo Day 🤮)

AI Tinkerers is all about building, so please make sure your demonstration is relevant and engaging for our community of builders, engineers, and entrepreneurs. Showcasing a particularly interesting technical challenge you encountered, the solution or hack you implemented, and the creative applications of AI in your work is great.

**Q: I just need a couple of slides to give some context**

A: No you don’t. Seriously…just cut straight to the demo and the code behind it. Your company name will stream through in the stack trace when your demo crashes. People who want to know more about the mission and value prop associated with your stuff will ask you during the networking portion of the evening.

**Q: I’m working on something but it’s really raw, some things are broken, the UI is ugly, I might have to restart it 2 times to show it working, but it does something quite novel. Is it ready to present?**

A: Yes! Sounds perfect! :)

**Q: As an attendee, is my contact information shared with sponsors?**

A: No, your contact information is not shared with sponsors. In fact, there isn’t even an “export emails” function exposed to event organizers. Furthermore, all event communications are managed through the software and you can easily opt-out via the unsubscribe link that is present in every email.

**Q: What is AI Tinkerers’ stance on diversity and inclusion?**

A: At AI Tinkerers, we champion diversity and inclusivity, recognizing that varied perspectives fuel innovation and elevate our collective knowledge. We welcome practitioners from all backgrounds while maintaining high technical standards for active AI builders. Our community thrives on quality ideas, groundbreaking innovations, and continuous learning. By fostering an environment where every voice is valued, we’re not just advancing AI – we’re redefining its future together. We believe that a diverse community of builders creates better, more innovative AI solutions that benefit everyone.
